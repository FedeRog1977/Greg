 			Since 2014, a new outlook upon language has evolved. Now, many originally called this new outlook the language of 'Minsewaadian', 'oooahhh Reeeahn's language', 'Greg's language', and so on. It has now become forever inscribed in the minds of modern society as 'Traditional Minsewaedian'. This 'language' takes a new and very unique approach to what the population of earth know to be phonetics, pragmatics, semantics and syntax. A popular example from nearer the time of birth of this 'language' is as follows: "oooooooahhhhhh Reeeeeaahn, geet an the beek. We need to warum up oor spagutti hups.".

			At this point you may be thinking that this sounds pretty useless for the average competent right-wing individual. However, if you ever find yourself in an undesirable situation in the city of Glenga, you can actually use this language to escape unwanted knife crime or 'ooah shunking', if you will. For example, you may be on Geography Field Trip Tour: Part XXVI and find yourself with a puncture when passing Stop III: the Emirates Arena. This arena is near oooah Coooltil Pooraw and therefore, there will be a 0.9999999 probability that there will be a hero    in junkie around the next corner you turn. Bringing oursselves back to Minsewaedian, if you simply state "ooooahhh moan the Shelics" to the junkie, he will give you a swift high-five and be on with his day - likely off to a store specialising in bug-ridden mattresses.
