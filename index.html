 			Since 2014, a new outlook upon language has evolved. N    ow, many originally called this new outlook the language of 'Minsewaad    ian', 'oooahhh Reeeahn's language', 'Greg's language', and so on. It h    as now become forever inscribed in the minds of modern
 19 society as 'Traditional Minsewaedian'. This 'language' takes a new and     very unique approach to what the population of earth know to be phone    tics, pragmatics, semantics and syntax. A popular example from nearer     the time of birth of this 'language' is as follows: "oooooooahhhhhh Re    eeeeaahn, geet an the beek. We need to warum up oor spagutti hups.".

			At this point you may be thinking that this sounds pretty useless for     the average competent right-wing individual. However, if you ever find     yourself in an undesirable situation in the city of Glenga, you can a    ctually use this language to escape unwanted knife crime or 'ooah shun    king', if you will. For example, you may be on Geography Field Trip To    ur: Part XXVI and find yourself with a puncture when passing stop III:     the Emirates Arena. This arena is near oooah Coooltil Pooraw and ther    efore, there will be a 0.9999999 probability that there will be a hero    in junkie around the next corner you turn. Bringing oursselves back to     Minsewaedian, if you simply state "ooooahhh moan the Shelics" to the     junkie, he will give you a swift high-five and be on with his day - li    kely off to a store specialising in bug-ridden mattresses.
